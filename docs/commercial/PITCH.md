*   **The Gap**: Current solutions are generic Hospital Information Systems (HIS) that ignore the specific needs of cognitive rehabilitation and non-pharmacological therapies.
*   **The Pain**: Therapists manage music therapy, cognitive stimulation, and physical rehab on paper or Excel, leading to data loss and inefficient reporting.

## 2. The Solution: Metodo Activa SaaS
We provide the **Operating System for Active Aging Centers**.
*   **Vertical SaaS**: Tailored specifically for Neuro-Rehab.
*   **Methodology Centric**: It's not just a database; it guides the therapist through the "Metodo Activa" protocols (ISO Music Therapy).
